## 🚀 Overview  
FocusFlow is a futuristic, premium landing page built to showcase an AI-powered “Productivity Operating System” — designed to attract users who want to automate tasks, manage habits, visualize productivity, and optimize their day with smart AI features.  
The project emphasizes an ultra-modern, cinematic, glassmorphism + neon-gradient UI / UX that stands out and demonstrates strong frontend design and development skills.

## 🎯 Key Features & Sections

- **Features Section** — Four floating feature cards (Smart Task Automation, AI Habit Coach, Daily Planner, Productivity Dashboard) with neon-glow hover effects and interactive animations.  
- **Testimonials Section** — Glass-effect testimonial cards in a clean horizontal slider layout, offering user/social proof.  
- **Pricing Section** — Three-tier pricing plans (Free, Pro, Enterprise) styled as gradient glass cards; Pro plan highlighted with glowing frame.  
- **Footer** — Dark-themed minimalist footer with navigation links and neon-style social icons.  
- Fully **responsive layout**, optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
- Smooth animations, floating elements, subtle transitions, and futuristic design aesthetic throughout — modern SaaS landing page feel.

## 🧰 Tech Stack  

- **Framework**: Next.js  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS  
- **UI Generation**: Vercel v0 (for generating initial component designs based on custom prompts)  
- **Deployment**: Vercel  

## 🛠️ How It Was Built  

1. I used **Vercel v0** to generate high-quality React components (JSX) styled with Tailwind, simply by feeding detailed prompts (for hero, features, pricing, etc.).  
2. After code generation, I imported the JSX into my Next.js project structure under `/components` and `/pages`.  
3. I reviewed and customized styling and layout — adjusted colors, spacing, responsiveness, and transitions to ensure a polished design.  
4. I combined generated sections into a full landing page, maintained clean component structure and folder organization.  
5. Reused UI patterns for consistency. Tested responsiveness manually across device sizes.  
6. Committed code to GitHub and deployed live on Vercel for instant preview and sharing.
